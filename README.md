## Prerequisites

Before installation, please make sure you have the right development environment:

- Node.js version >= 11.10.1 (you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node.js)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) (dependency management for node.js modules)

## Installation

Run the below command to install dependencies:

```sh
yarn # or yarn install
```

## Get Started

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Development

### Format Document

All files (`.md`/`.js`) will be formatted automatically when commit changes. Please make sure you have installed all dependencies (`yarn`) otherwise the files won't be formatted automatically.

```text
type(scope): description
```

But make sure the PR title follow above pattern and common types can be:

- add
- update
- fix

- revert

For real world examples, please see [commit logs](https://github.com/ThinkBucket/docsite/commits/master).
