## Start local server

### Prerequisites

Before installation, please make sure you have the right development environment:

- Node.js version >= 11.10.1 (you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node.js)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) (dependency management for node.js modules)

### Installation

Run the below command to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn # or yarn install
```

### Start

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

:::tip

There is no need to restart server except modifying `sidebars` and `docusaurus.config.js`.

:::

## Create a new file

Create new `file.md` file or new category in corresponding directory of `docs`

### Using number prefixes

A simple way to order an autogenerated sidebar is to prefix docs and folders by number prefixes, which also makes them appear in the file system in the same order when sorted by file name:

```text
docs
├── 01-Intro.md
├── 02-Tutorial Easy
│   ├── 01-First Part.md
│   ├── 02-Second Part.md
│   └── 03-End.md
├── 03-Tutorial Hard
│   ├── 01-First Part.md
│   ├── 02-Second Part.md
│   ├── 03-Third Part.md
│   └── 04-End.md
└── 04-End.md
```

To make it **easier to adopt**, Docusaurus supports **multiple number prefix patterns**.

By default, Docusaurus will **remove the number prefix** from the doc id, title, label, and URL paths.

See more details: https://www.docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata

### Front matter

open the new file you just added and add following front-matter:

```md
---
title: Name of Second Level Item in Sidebar
---
```

:::

## Create a new category

### Step 1: create new directory

Add new directory and files in `docs`.

### Step 2: create new file

Same as above.

### Step 3: register entry

Add new category in `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js {12-14} title="docusaurus.config.js"
{
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      items: [
        {
          label: '',
          position: '',
          to: '',
          activeBaseRegex: '',
          items: [
            {
              to: 'docs/xxx/01-xxx/01-xxx',
              activeBasePath: 'docs/xxx/',
              label: 'Xxx',
            },
          ],
        },
      ];
    }
  }
}
```
