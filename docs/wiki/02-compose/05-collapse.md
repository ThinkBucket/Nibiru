<summary>Do I have needs to cooperate?</summary>

- 游리 Self-hosted services can achieve the same effect as Netlify, but with much more heavy-lifting. Usually, you would have a specific person who looks after the deployment, and the workflow won't be very git-based as opposed to the other two options.
- 游릭 Netlify and Vercel have deploy previews for every pull request, which is useful for a team to review work before merging to production. You can also manage a team with different member access to the deployment.
- 游리 GitHub Pages cannot do deploy previews in a non-convoluted way. One repo can only be associated with one site deployment. On the other hand, you can control who has write access to the site's deployment.
