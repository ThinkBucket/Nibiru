In this section, you will learn below keywords of MySQL:

- SELECT
- FROM
- DISTINCT
- LIMIT
- AS
- ORDER BY
- ASC
- DESC

Example table: _user_profile_

| id  | device_id | gender | age | university          | gpa |
| --- | --------- | ------ | --- | ------------------- | --- |
| 1   | 2138      | male   | 21  | Peking University   | 3.4 |
| 2   | 3214      | male   |     | Fudan University    | 4.0 |
| 3   | 6543      | female | 20  | Peking University   | 3.2 |
| 4   | 2315      | female | 23  | Zhejiang University | 3.6 |
| 5   | 5432      | male   | 25  | Shandong University | 3.8 |

## Query Data

The `SELECT` statement allows you to select data from one or more tables.

### Query data from a single col

To write a `SELECT` statement in MySQL, you use this syntax:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name;
```

In this syntax:

1. Specify one or more columns from which you want to select data after the `SELECT` keyword. If the select_list has multiple columns, you need to separate them by a comma (`,`).
2. Specify the name of the table from which you want to select data after the `FROM` keyword.

The semicolon (`;`) is optional. It denotes the end of a statement. If you have two or more statements, you need to use the semicolon(`;`) to separate them so that MySQL will execute each statement individually.

:::tip

The `SELECT` and `FROM` are the keywords. By convention, you write the SQL keywords in uppercase. However, it’s not mandatory. Because SQL is **case-insensitive**, you can write the SQL statement in lowercase, uppercase, etc.

:::

For example:

```sql
SELECT device_id FROM user_profile;
```

Above SQL clause is used to query the colum `device_id` from `user_profile` table.

| device_id |
| --------- |
| 2138      |
| 3214      |
| 6543      |
| 2315      |
| 5432      |

When executing the SELECT statement, MySQL evaluates the FROM clause before the `SELECT` clause:

### Query data from multiple cols

The following example uses the `SELECT` statement to get the `device_id` and `gender` :

```sql
SELECT device_id, gender FROM user_profile;
```

| device_id | gender |
| --------- | ------ |
| 2138      | male   |
| 3214      | male   |
| 6543      | female |
| 2315      | female |
| 5432      | male   |

### Query data from all cols

If you want to select data from all the columns of the `user_profile` table, you can specify all the column names in the `SELECT` clause or use the asterisk (\*) which is the shorthand for all columns. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_profile;
```

The query returns data from all the columns of the `user_profile` table.

:::tip

The `SELECT *` is often called “select star” or “select all” since it selects data from all columns of the table. In practice, you should use the `SELECT *` for the ad-hoc queries only.

:::

## Simply handle the result set

### Eliminate duplicate rows

When querying data from a table, you may get duplicate rows. To remove these duplicate rows, you use the `DISTINCT` clause in the `SELECT` statement.

For example, you want to remove duplicate age rows in a result set:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  age
FROM
  user_profile;
```

In this syntax, you specify one or more columns that you want to select distinct values after the `SELECT DISTINCT` keywords.

If you specify one column, the `DISTINCT` clause will evaluate the uniqueness of rows based on the values of that column.

However, if you specify two or more columns, the `DISTINCT` clause will use the combination of values in these columns to determine the uniqueness of the row in the result set.

When executing the `SELECT` statement with the `DISTINCT` clause, MySQL evaluates the `DISTINCT` clause after the `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `SELECT` clause and before the `ORDER BY` clause:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/4Fsp0N.jpg' w='550'/>

:::tip

When you specify a column that has `NULL` values in the `DISTINCT` clause, the `DISTINCT` clause will keep only one `NULL` value because it considers all `NULL` values are the same.

:::

### Constrain the number of rows

By default, the `SELECT` statement will return all rows. However, sometimes we don't want all rows. In this scenario, we can use LIMIT clause to constrain the number of rows to return. The `LIMIT` clause accepts one or two arguments. The values of both arguments must be **≥ 0**.

In this example, it constrains 5 rows to return:

```sql
SELECT device_id FROM user_profile LIMIT 5;
```

:::tip

By default, the `SELECT` statement returns rows in an unspecified order. When you add the `LIMIT` clause to the `SELECT` statement, the returned rows are unpredictable.

Therefore, to ensure the `LIMIT` clause returns an expected output, you should always use it with an `ORDER BY`.

:::

### Alias for columns

Sometimes, column names are so technical that make the query’s output very difficult to understand. To give a column a descriptive name, you can use a column alias.

The following statement illustrates how to use the column alias:

```sql
SELECT device_id AS active_user FROM user_profile;
```

To assign an alias to a column, you use the `AS` keyword followed by the alias. If the alias contains spaces, you must quote it as the following:

```sql
SELECT device_id AS `active user` FROM user_profile;
```

Note that you can also give an expression an alias. The following query selects the first names and last names of employees. It uses the `CONCAT_WS()` function to concatenate first name and last name into full name.

```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT_WS(', ', lastName, firstname)
FROM
    employees;
```

The column heading is quite difficult to read. To solve this, you can assign the column heading of the output a column alias as shown in the following query:

```sql
SELECT
   CONCAT_WS(', ', lastName, firstname) AS `Full name`
FROM
   employees;
```

:::tip

In MySQL, you can use the column alias in the `ORDER BY` clause to refer to the column. [See More](/docs/sql/4.dql/4.group-by#分组过滤-having)

:::

## Order the result set

When you use the `SELECT` statement to query data from a table, the order of rows in the result set is unspecified. If not sorted, the data is generally displayed in the order in which it appears in the underlying table. To sort the rows in the result set, you add the `ORDER BY` clause to the `SELECT` statement.

### Order by one col

The following illustrates the syntax of the `ORDER BY` clause used in one column:

```sql
SELECT age
FROM user_profile
ORDER BY age
```

You can see that the results are sorted in ascending order by age:

| age  |
| ---- |
| NULL |
| 20   |
| 21   |
| 23   |
| 25   |

### Order by multiple cols

If you want to sort the result set by multiple columns, you specify a comma-separated list of columns in the `ORDER BY` clause. It will be sorted in the order given by the columns。

```sql
SELECT device_id, age, gpa
FROM user_profile
ORDER BY age, gpa;
```

As you can see that the results are first sorted in ascending order by `age`, and then sorted in ascending order according to `gpa`:

| device_id | age  | gpa |
| --------- | ---- | --- |
| 3214      | NULL | 4   |
| 6543      | 20   | 3.2 |
| 2138      | 21   | 3.4 |
| 2315      | 23   | 3.6 |
| 5432      | 25   | 3.8 |

:::tip

The priority of `age` sorting is greater than `gpa`, that is, when the `age` appears the same value, `gpa` will be used to sort again, if the `age` is different values, then the `gpa` sorting will not work.

:::

### `ASC` and `DESC`

The `ASC` stands for ascending and the `DESC` stands for descending. By default, `ORDER BY` sorts the data in ascending order (from A to Z), and we can also use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the data in descending (from Z to A). For descending sorting, you must specify the `DESC` keyword. Let's look at the following query:

```sql
SELECT age
FROM user_profile
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

The same query statement adds `DESC` to the end of `ORDER BY` and you can see that the results are sorted in descending order by `age`:

| age  |
| ---- |
| 25   |
| 23   |
| 21   |
| 20   |
| NULL |

:::tip

The `DESC` and `ASC` keywords only apply to the columns that directly precede it.

For example, if the SQL statement is written as `ORDER BY age DESC, gpa`, then it will first sort the result set in descending order by `age` and then in ascending order by `gpa`.
