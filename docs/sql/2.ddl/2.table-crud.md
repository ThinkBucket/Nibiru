## `CREATE TABLE`

### Syntax

The following illustrates the basic syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
) ENGINE=storage_engine;
```

Let’s examine the syntax in greater detail:

1. You specify the name of the table that you want to create after the `CREATE TABLE` keywords. The table name must be **unique** within a database. The `IF NOT EXISTS` is optional. It allows you to check if the table that you create already exists in the database. If this is the case, MySQL will ignore the whole statement and will not create any new table.
2. You specify a list of columns of the table in the column_list section, columns are separated by commas.
3. You can optionally specify the storage engine for the table in the `ENGINE` clause. You can use any storage engine such as InnoDB and MyISAM. If you don’t explicitly declare a storage engine, MySQL will use InnoDB by default.

:::info

InnoDB became the default storage engine since MySQL version 5.5. The InnoDB storage engine brings many benefits of a relational database management system such as **ACID** transaction, referential integrity, and crash recovery. In the previous versions, MySQL used MyISAM as the default storage engine.

:::

The following shows the syntax for a column’s definition:

```sql
column_name data_type(length) [NOT NULL] [DEFAULT value] [AUTO_INCREMENT] column_constraint;
```

Here are the details:

- The `column_name` specifies the name of the column. Each column has a specific data type and optional size e.g. `VARCHAR(255)`
- The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that the column will not contain `NULL`. Besides the `NOT NULL` constraint, a column may have - additional constraint such as `CHECK`, and `UNIQUE`.
- The `DEFAULT` specifies a default value for the column.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` indicates that the value of the column is incremented by one automatically whenever a new row is inserted - into the table. Each table has a maximum one `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

After the column list, you can define table constraints such as `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`.

For example, if you want to set a column or a group of columns as the primary key, you use the following syntax:

```sql
PRIMARY KEY (col1,col2,...)
```

### Example

Let’s take some examples of creating new tables. The following statement creates a new table named `tasks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    task_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE,
    due_date DATE,
    status TINYINT NOT NULL,
    priority TINYINT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)  ENGINE=INNODB;
```

The tasks table has the following columns:

- The `task_id` is an auto-increment column. If you use the `INSERT` statement to insert a new row into the table without specifying a value for the `task_id` column, MySQL will automatically generate a sequential integer for the `task_id` starting from **1**.
- The `title` column is a variable character string column whose maximum length is 255. It means that you cannot insert a string whose length is greater than 255 into this column. The `NOT NULL` constraint indicates that the column does not accept `NULL`. In other words, you have to provide a non-NULL value when you insert or update this column.
- The `start_date` and `due_date` are `DATE` columns. Because these columns do not have the `NOT NULL` constraint, they can store `NULL`. The `start_date` column has a default value of the current date. In other words, if you don’t provide a value for the `start_date` column when you insert a new row, the `start_date` column will take the current date of the **database server**.
- The `status` and `priority` are the `TINYINT` columns which do not allow `NULL`.
- The `description` column is a `TEXT` column that accepts `NULL`.
- The `created_at` is a `TIMESTAMP` column that accepts the current time as the default value.

The `task_id` is the primary key column of the `tasks` table. It means that the values in the `task_id` column will uniquely identify rows in the table.

Once you execute the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create the `tasks` table, you can view its structure by using the `DESCRIBE` statement:

```sql
DESCRIBE tasks;
```

## `AUTO_INCREMENT`

In MySQL, a sequence is a list of integers generated in the ascending order i.e., 1,2,3… Many applications **need sequences to generate unique numbers mainly for identification** e.g., customer ID in CRM, employee numbers in HR, and equipment numbers in the services management system.

### Syntax

To create a sequence in MySQL automatically, you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute for a column, which typically is a primary key column.

```sql
column_name INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE
```

The following rules are applied when you use the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute:

- Each table has **only one** `AUTO_INCREMENT` column whose data type is typically the integer.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column must be indexed, which means it can be either `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` index.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column must have a `NOT NULL` constraint. When you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute to a column, MySQL automatically adds the `NOT NULL` constraint to the column **implicitly**.

### Example

The following statement creates a table named `employees` that has the `emp_no` column is an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_no INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

:::tip

The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column has the following attributes:

- The starting value of an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is **1** and it is increased by 1 when you insert a `NULL` value into the column or when you omit its value in the `INSERT` statement.
- To obtain the last generated sequence number, you use the `LAST_INSERT_ID()` function. We often use the last insert ID for the subsequent statements e.g., insert data into the tables. The last generated sequence is unique across sessions. In other words, if another connection generates a sequence number, from your connection you can obtain it by using `the LAST_INSERT_ID()` function.
- If you insert a new row into a table and specify a value for the sequence column, MySQL will insert the sequence number if the sequence number does not exist in the column or issue an error if it already exists. If you insert a new value that is greater than the next sequence number, MySQL will use the new value as the starting sequence number and generate a unique sequence number greater than the current one for the next usage. This creates gaps in the sequence.
- If you use the `UPDATE` statement to update values in the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a value that already exists, MySQL will issue a duplicate-key error if the column has a unique index. If you update an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a value that is greater than the existing values in the column, MySQL will use the next number of the **last** insert sequence number for the next row. For example, if the last insert sequence number is 3, you update it to 10, the sequence number for the new row is 4.
- If you use the `DELETE` statement to delete the last inserted row, MySQL may or may not reuse the deleted sequence number depending on the storage engine of the table.
  - A MyISAM table does not reuse the deleted sequence numbers if you delete a row e.g., the last insert id in the table is 10, if you remove it, MySQL still generates the next sequence number which is 11 for the new row.
  - Similar to MyISAM tables, InnoDB tables do not reuse sequence number when rows are deleted.

:::

Once you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute for a column, you can reset the auto increment value in various ways e.g., by using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

## `GENERATED ALWAYS`

### Background

When you create a new table, you specify the table columns in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Then, you use the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to modify directly the data in the table columns.

:::info

MySQL 5.7 introduced a new feature called the generated column. Columns are generated because the data in these columns are **computed** based on predefined expressions.

:::

For example, you have the `contacts` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

To get the full name of a contact, you use the `CONCAT()` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name), email FROM contacts;
```

This is not the most beautiful query yet. By using the MySQL generated column, you can recreate the `contacts` table as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fullname varchar(101) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)),
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

The `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` is the syntax for creating a generated column. To test the `fullname` column, you insert a row into the `contacts` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO contacts(first_name,last_name, email)
VALUES('john','doe','kiki@abc.com');
```

Now, you can query data from the `contacts` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts;
```

<Img w="400" align="left" src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/NhDcvs.png' />

The values in the `fullname` column are computed on the fly when you query data from the `contacts` table.

MySQL provides two types of generated columns:

- **Virtual** columns are calculated on the fly each time data is read.
- **Stored** column are calculated and stored physically when the data is updated.

Based on this definition, the `fullname` column that in the example above is a virtual column.

### Syntax

```sql
column_name data_type [GENERATED ALWAYS] AS (expression) [VIRTUAL | STORED] [UNIQUE [KEY]]
```

First, specify the column name and its data type.

Next, add the `GENERATED ALWAYS` clause to indicate that the column is a generated column.

Then, specify the expression within the braces after the `AS` keyword. The expression can contain literals, built-in functions with no parameters, operators, or references to any column within the same table. If you use a function, it must be scalar and deterministic.

After that, indicate whether the type of the generated column by using the corresponding option: `VIRTUAL` or `STORED`. By default, MySQL uses `VIRTUAL` if you don’t specify explicitly the type of the generated column.

Finally, if the generated column is stored, you can define a unique constraint for it.

### Example

Let’s look at the `products` table in the sample database.

<Img w="280" align="left" src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/R7YL80.png' />

The data from `quantityInStock` and `buyPrice` columns allow us to calculate the stock’s value per SKU using the following expression:

```sql
quantityInStock * buyPrice
```

However, we can add a stored generated column named `stock_value` to the `products` table using the following `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN stockValue DOUBLE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantityInStock * buyPrice) STORED;
```

Typically, the `ALTER TABLE` statement requires a full table rebuild, therefore, it is time-consuming if you change the big tables. However, this is not the case for the virtual column.

Now, we can query the `stock_value` directly from the `products` table.

```sql
SELECT productName, ROUND(stockValue, 2) stock_value FROM products;
```

<Img w="360" align="left" src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/3o1H63.png' />

## Show Table Structure

After creating tables by SQL statement, we can check the definition of table. In MySQL, using `DESCRIBE` and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements to show the table structure, see as follows:

### Using SQL

#### Show the basic structure: `DESCRIBE`

`DESCRIBE` or `DESC` statement can show the field info including column name, type, is primary and default value. Syntax as following shows:

```sql
DESCRIBE <table_name>;
```

or

```sql
DESC <table_name>;
```

For example, let’s look at the `products` table structure in the sample database.

```sql
DESC products;
```

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/KuTvQW.png' />

- **Null**: whether can store NULL value
- **Key**: means this column has been indexed
  - **PRI**: means it's the part of table primary key
  - **UNI**: means it's the part of UNIQUE index
  - **MUL**: means it allow the specific value can be shown in many times
- **Default**: default value
- **Extra**: extra info such as `AUTO_INCREMENT`

#### Show the detailed structure: `SHOW CREATE TABLE`

This statement can show the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements when creating table, syntax as follows:

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE <table_name>\G;
```

:::info

When using `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, it can not only show the detailed statements, but also shows the store engines and character encoding.

:::

The results may be in chaos if miss `\G` at the end.

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Xnip2022-04-03_22-15-12.png' />

Adding `\G` to make the result more visible:

### Using TablePlus

It's very simple to show table structure in TablePlus, follow the steps as below shows:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dhWew7.png' />

You can run SQL statements in TablePlus as well:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/hd6Tr3.png' />

:::info

There is no need to add `\G` when using `SHOW CREATE TABLE` in TablePlus.

:::

## Drop Table

### Using SQL

#### Syntax

To remove existing tables, you use the MySQL `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS] table_name [, table_name] ... [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```

The `DROP TABLE` statement removes a table and its data **permanently** from the database. In MySQL, you can also remove multiple tables using a single **DROP TABLE** statement, each table is separated by a comma (`,`).

The `TEMPORARY` option allows you to remove temporary tables only. It ensures that you do not accidentally remove non-temporary tables.

The `IF EXISTS` option conditionally drop a table only if it exists. If you drop a non-existing table with the `IF EXISTS` option, MySQL generates a NOTE, which can be retrieved using the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement.

:::tip

Note that the `DROP TABLE` statement only drops tables. It doesn’t remove specific user privileges associated with the tables. Therefore, if you create a table with the same name as the dropped one, MySQL will apply the existing privileges to the new table, which may pose a security risk.

:::

The `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE` options are reserved for the future versions of MySQL.

To execute the `DROP TABLE` statement, you must have `DROP` privileges for the table that you want to remove.

#### Example

The basic usage is straightforward, let's take the example of attempting to drop a non-existing table:

```sql
DROP TABLE aliens;
```

MySQL issued the following error:

```shell
Error Code: 1051. Unknown table 'classicmodels.aliens'
```

However, if you use the `IF EXISTS` option in the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS aliens;
```

MySQL issued a warning instead:

```shell
0 row(s) affected, 1 warning(s): 1051 Unknown table 'classicmodels.aliens'
```

To show the warning, you can use the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement:

```sql
SHOW WARNINGS;
```

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/cqH73L.png' />

#### DROP Table with Referential Constraints

If the Employee table has some primary key, which is referred in other child tables, then first we have to drop referential constraints from the child table and then you can drop the parent table.

Let's take an example, first we need to create two tables with referential constraints as follows:

```sql title="Parent Table: departments"
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(22),
    location VARCHAR(50)
);
```

```sql title="Child Table: employees"
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(25),
    deptId INT(11),
    salary FLOAT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept FOREIGN KEY (deptId) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

Let use `SHOW CREATE TABLE employees\G;` to check the foreign key constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `employees` (
    `id` int NOT NULL,
    `name` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
    `deptId` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `salary` float DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `fk_emp_dept` (`deptId`),
    CONSTRAINT `fk_emp_dept` FOREIGN KEY (`deptId`) REFERENCES `departments` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

If we drop parent table directly, it will hit the error as below:

```sql
DROP TABLE departments;
Query 1 ERROR: Cannot drop table 'departments' referenced by a foreign key constraint 'fk_emp_dept' on table 'employees'.
```

If we want drop parent table, we need remove foreign key constraint first:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_emp_dept;
```

After run above SQL statement, it will disassociate `employee` table and `department` table. At this time, we can drop `employee` table without error:

```sql
DROP departments;
Query 1 OK: 0 rows affected
```

### Using TablePlus

If you would like to drop the table, you can just right click the table and select `Delete...`:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Xnip2022-04-10_22-24-57.png' />

After that, there will be shown a dialog with some options as below. Since we are using MySQL, only `ignore foreign key checks` can work fine.

:::tip

You'd better not use shortcut which will drop table directly without showing dialog.

:::

At last, you need to commit this change as well:
