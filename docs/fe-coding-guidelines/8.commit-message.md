Why are commit messages important?

- To speed up and streamline code reviews
- To help in the understanding of a change
- To explain "the whys" that cannot be described only with code
- To help future maintainers figure out why and how changes were made, making troubleshooting and debugging easier
- To maximize those outcomes, we can use some good practices and standards described in the next section.

### Rule1: Use imperative form

A commit message describes what the referenced change actually does, its effects, not what was done.

:::bad

```git
used InventoryBackendPool to retrieve inventory backend
```

:::

:::good

```git
use InventoryBackendPool to retrieve inventory backend
```

::::

### Rule2: Do not capitalize the first letter

:::bad

```git
Add `use` method to Credit model
```

:::

:::good

```git
add `use` method to Credit model
```

:::

### Rule3: Use the message body to explain "why", "for what", "how" and additional details

It is useful in many scenarios (e.g. multiple commits, several changes and refactors) to help reviewers understand what the committer was thinking.

:::bad

```git
add `use` method
```

:::

:::good

```git
add `use` method to Credit model
```

:::

:::bad

```git
adjust css
```

:::

:::good

```git
increase left padding between textbox and layout frame
```

:::

### Rule4: Try to communicate what the change does without having to look at the source code

The subject and the body of the messages are separated by a blank line. Additional blank lines are considered as a part of the message body.

Characters like `-`, `*` and ` are elements that improve readability.

:::good

```git
fix method name of InventoryBackend child classes

classes derived from InventoryBackend were not respecting the base class interface.

it worked because the cart was calling the backend implementation incorrectly.
```

:::

:::good

```git
serialize and deserialize credits to json in Cart

convert the Credit instances to dict for two main reasons:

  - pickle relies on file path for classes and we do not want to break up
    everything if a refactor is needed
  - dict and built-in types are pickleable by default
```

:::

:::good

```git
add `use` method to Credit

change from namedtuple to class because we need to
setup a new attribute (in_use_amount) with a new value
```

:::

### Rule5: Avoid generic messages or messages without any context

:::bad

```git
fix this
```

```git
fix stuff
```

```git
it should work now
```

```git
change stuff
```

```git
adjust css
```

:::

### Rule6: Limit the number of columns

[It's recommended](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines) to use a maximum of 50 characters for the subject and 72 for the body.

### Rule7: Keep language consistency

For project owners: Choose a language and write all commit messages using that language. We recommend English as standard commit language. Ideally, it should match the code comments, default translation locale (for localized projects), etc.

:::good

```git
add `use` method to Credit model
```

```git
use InventoryBackendPool to retrieve inventory backend
```

```git
fix method name of InventoryBackend child classes
```

Portuguese example:

:::bad

```git
adiciona o método `use` ao model Credit
```

```git
usa o InventoryBackendPool para recuperar o backend de estoque
```

```git
corrige nome de método na classe InventoryBackend
```

:::

Mixes English and Portuguese:

:::bad

```git
usa o InventoryBackendPool para recuperar o backend de estoque
```

```git
add `use` method to Credit model
```

```git
agora vai
```
