## What is singleton

The Singleton pattern is known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.

Singleton pattern not only can reduce unnecessary memory overhead, but also play significant role in reducing global function and variable conflicts.

## Basic singleton in JS

Even if you don't know too much about singleton, I believe that you've used it. Let's take a look at the following code:

```js
const foo = {
  doSomethingA: function() {},
  doSomethingB: function() {}
};
```

Creating objects with object literals is common in JS. The above object encapsulates two methods of doing something in the form of object literals. Only one object(`foo`) is exposed globally, and when needed, it is simply a `foo.doSomethingA()` call. The `foo` object is the simplest singleton pattern. The way you create objects in JS is very flexible, allowing you to instantiate an object directly through object literals, whereas other object-oriented languages must instantiate using classes. So, `foo` here is already an instance, and the `let` and `const` feature in ES6 that does not allow repeated declarations ensures that `foo` cannot be assigned.

## Lazy singleton

Suppose the following cases:

1. The object requires some private variables and private methods.
2. The object itself is quite complicated, so it will take additional time to create before usage.

So, it is no longer possible to use object literals to create singleton. Instead, we need to instantiate the object as a constructor.

### ES5

Here's how to transform the above `foo` object by **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** and constructor in ES5 syntax.

```js
let Singleton = (function(name) {
  let instance = null;

  function init() {
    (this.name = name), (this.doSomething = function() {}); // method
  }

  return function() {
    if (!instance) {
      // (i)
      instance = new init();
    }
    return instance;
  };
})();
```

The above `Singleton` is actually a **IIFE**, `instance` as the instance is initially assigned to `null`, `init` is actually a constructor, used to instantiate the object, the immediate execution of the function returns an anonymous function to determine whether the instance is created, only when `Singleton()` is called to instantiate the instance.

Because the **IIFE** returns a function(actually, it's a **closure**, [see more](/docs/javascript/3.closure/closure-external)), the instance is created only when first call through `Singleton()`. This is the **lazy singleton**. Instead of creating instance when loading, the instance is created only when needed, then if `Singleton()` is called again, the first instance object will be returned.

```js
let instanceA = Singleton();
let instanceB = Singleton(); // skip (i)
console.log(instanceA === instanceB); //true
```

In addition, the singleton in JS usually is to manage shared application state, such as using a singleton as the source of config settings for a web app on the client side for anything initiated with an API key, storing data in memory in a client-side web application (e.g. stores in Redux). So, `Singleton` can be seen as `Store` and `instance` as shared `data` to some extent.

### ES6

```js
class Singleton {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  // method
  doSomething() {}
  //static method
  static getInstance(name) {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new Singleton(name);
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
}
```

```js
let instanceA = Singleton.getInstance('');
let instanceB = Singleton.getInstance('');

console.log(instanceA === instanceB); //true
```

## Singleton in React

The singleton in react is a bit different from that in JS. Classically, if an instance already exists, it will simply return a reference to that object. In react, however, it should not render(or create element) rather than returning a reference to the object because the `render()` method has encapsulated the creation method `React.createElement()`.

Suppose that we create a component called Aside(a bit like Modal), it is important to keep the backdrop single when the asides are nested. Take below as an example:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/singleton-aside.gif'/>

As asides can be nested in multiple layers and the backdrop is transparent grey, to prevent the color from getting darker, the backdrop must be single:

<Img src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dS3v4u.png'/>

We can simply implement singleton in react as following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Backdrop extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      hasExisted: !!document.getElementsByClassName('dialog__backdrop')[0]
    };
  }
  handleClick = () => {
    this.props.onClick && this.props.onClick();
  };
  render() {
    return !this.state.hasExisted
      ? ReactDOM.createPortal(
          <div className="dialog__backdrop" onClick={this.handleClick} />,
          document.body
        )
      : null;
  }
}

export default Backdrop;
```
