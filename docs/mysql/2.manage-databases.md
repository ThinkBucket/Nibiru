## Using Terminal

When you log in to a MySQL database server using the mysql client tool without specifying a database name, MySQL server will set the current database to `NULL`.

First, log in to MySQL using the `root` user account:

```shell
mysql -u root -p
```

MySQL will prompt you for a password:

```shell
Enter password:
```

To log in, you need to provide the correct password of the root user account and press `Enter`.

### `SHOW DATABASES`

If you need to find which databases are available on your server by using the show databases statement:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

The output may look like the following:

```shell
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### `SELECT database()`

To display the current database, you use the following statement:

```sql
SELECT database();
```

It’ll return the following:

```shell
+------------+
| database() |
+------------+
| NULL       |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

It means the current database is not set. If you issue a statement, MySQL will issue an error. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t;
```

Error:

```shell
ERROR 1046 (3D000): No database selected
```

### `USE database_name`

To select a database to work with, you use the `USE` statement:

```sql
USE database_name;
```

For example, the following statement uses the `USE` statement to set the current database to `testdb`:

```sql
USE testdb;
```

If you see the following message, it means that you have changed the database to `testdb` successfully:

```shell
Database changed
```

To verify it, you can use the select `database()` statement:

```sql
SELECT database();
```

It’ll return something like:

```shell
+---------------+
| database()    |
+---------------+
| testdb |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

If the `testdb` database doesn’t exist, you’ll get the following error after executing the `USE` statement:

```shell
ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'testdb'
```

:::tip

If you know which database you want to work with before you log in, you can use the `-D` flag. For example, the following command connects to the `testdb` database with the user account `root`:

```shell
mysql -u root -D testdb -p
```

In this command, we specify the database `testdb` after the `-D` flag.

### `CREATE DATABASE`

To create a new database in MySQL, you use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement with the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name
[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
[COLLATE collation_name]
```

In this syntax:

- First, specify name of the database after the the `CREATE DATABASE` keywords. The database name must be unique within a MySQL server instance. If you attempt to create a database with a name that already exists, MySQL will issue an error.
- Second, use the `IF NOT EXISTS` option to conditionally create a database if it doesn’t exist.
- Third, specify the **character set** and **collation** for the new database. If you skip the `CHARACTER SET` and `COLLATE` clauses, MySQL will set the default character and collation for the new database.

:::info

Since MySQL8.0, the default character set is changed from `Latin1` to `utf8mb4` and default collation is changed to `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.

> `utf8mb4_ 0900_ai_ci` is a further subdivision of unicode.
>
> - `0900` is the unicode collation algorithm version.
> - `ai` means accent insensitive, e.g. ê, é, è and ë are treated equally.
> - `_ci` is an abbreviation for case insensitive which means that "A" and "a" are equal when sorting and comparing.

:::

### `DROP DATABASE`

The DROP DATABASE statement drops all tables in the database and deletes the database permanently. Therefore, you need to be very careful when using this statement.

The following shows the syntax of the DROP DATABASE statement:

```sql
DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name;
```

In this statement, you specify the name of the database which you want to delete after the `DROP DATABASE` keywords.

If you drop a database that does not exist, MySQL will issue an error.

To prevent an error from occurring if you delete a non-existing database, you can use the `IF EXISTS` option. In this case, MySQL will terminate the statement without issuing any error.

The `DROP DATABASE` statement returns the number of tables it deleted.

In MySQL, the schema is the synonym for the database. Therefore, you can use them interchangeably:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA [IF EXISTS] database_name;
```

## Using TablePlus

### Select Database

If you connect to a MySQL Server via the [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) application, you can select a database when you create the database connection as shown in the following screenshot:

Once logged in, you can also select another database by clicking the database icon on toolbar or using the shortcut: `CMD K` provided by TablePlus:

### Create Database

### Drop Database

:::caution

Please note that you have to switch to other database before dropping the database, otherwise there will be shown a waring dialog to stop dropping.
