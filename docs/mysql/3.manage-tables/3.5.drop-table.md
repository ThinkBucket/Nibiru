title: Drop Table
---

## Using SQL

### Syntax

To remove existing tables, you use the MySQL `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS] table_name [, table_name] ... [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```

The `DROP TABLE` statement removes a table and its data **permanently** from the database. In MySQL, you can also remove multiple tables using a single **DROP TABLE** statement, each table is separated by a comma (`,`).

The `TEMPORARY` option allows you to remove temporary tables only. It ensures that you do not accidentally remove non-temporary tables.

The `IF EXISTS` option conditionally drop a table only if it exists. If you drop a non-existing table with the `IF EXISTS` option, MySQL generates a NOTE, which can be retrieved using the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement.

:::tip

Note that the `DROP TABLE` statement only drops tables. It doesnâ€™t remove specific user privileges associated with the tables. Therefore, if you create a table with the same name as the dropped one, MySQL will apply the existing privileges to the new table, which may pose a security risk.

:::

The `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE` options are reserved for the future versions of MySQL.

To execute the `DROP TABLE` statement, you must have `DROP` privileges for the table that you want to remove.

### Example

The basic usage is straightforward, let's take the example of attempting to drop a non-existing table:

```sql
DROP TABLE aliens;
```

MySQL issued the following error:

```shell
Error Code: 1051. Unknown table 'classicmodels.aliens'
```

However, if you use the `IF EXISTS` option in the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS aliens;
```

MySQL issued a warning instead:

```shell
0 row(s) affected, 1 warning(s): 1051 Unknown table 'classicmodels.aliens'
```

To show the warning, you can use the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement:

```sql
SHOW WARNINGS;
```

### DROP Table with Referential Constraints

If the Employee table has some primary key, which is referred in other child tables, then first we have to drop referential constraints from the child table and then you can drop the parent table.

Let's take an example, first we need to create two tables with referential constraints as follows:

```sql title="Parent Table: departments"
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(22),
    location VARCHAR(50)
);
```

```sql title="Child Table: employees"
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(25),
    deptId INT(11),
    salary FLOAT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept FOREIGN KEY (deptId) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

Let use `SHOW CREATE TABLE employees\G;` to check the foreign key constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `employees` (
    `id` int NOT NULL,
    `name` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
    `deptId` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `salary` float DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `fk_emp_dept` (`deptId`),
    CONSTRAINT `fk_emp_dept` FOREIGN KEY (`deptId`) REFERENCES `departments` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

If we drop parent table directly, it will hit the error as below:

```sql
DROP TABLE departments;
Query 1 ERROR: Cannot drop table 'departments' referenced by a foreign key constraint 'fk_emp_dept' on table 'employees'.
```

If we want drop parent table, we need remove foreign key constraint first:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_emp_dept;
```

After run above SQL statement, it will disassociate `employee` table and `department` table. At this time, we can drop `employee` table without error:

```sql
DROP departments;
Query 1 OK: 0 rows affected
```

## Using TablePlus

If you would like to drop the table, you can just right click the table and select `Delete...`:

After that, there will be shown a dialog with some options as below. Since we are using MySQL, only `ignore foreign key checks` can work fine.

:::tip

You'd better not use shortcut which will drop table directly without showing dialog.

At last, you need to commit this change as well:
