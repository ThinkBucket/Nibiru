## `CREATE TABLE`

### Syntax

The following illustrates the basic syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
) ENGINE=storage_engine;
```

Let’s examine the syntax in greater detail:

1. You specify the name of the table that you want to create after the `CREATE TABLE` keywords. The table name must be **unique** within a database. The `IF NOT EXISTS` is optional. It allows you to check if the table that you create already exists in the database. If this is the case, MySQL will ignore the whole statement and will not create any new table.
2. You specify a list of columns of the table in the column_list section, columns are separated by commas.
3. You can optionally specify the [storage engine](/docs/mysql/3.manage-tables/3.1.storage-engines) for the table in the `ENGINE` clause. You can use any storage engine such as InnoDB and MyISAM. If you don’t explicitly declare a storage engine, MySQL will use InnoDB by default.

:::info

InnoDB became the default storage engine since MySQL version 5.5. The InnoDB storage engine brings many benefits of a relational database management system such as **ACID** transaction, referential integrity, and crash recovery. In the previous versions, MySQL used MyISAM as the default storage engine.

:::

The following shows the syntax for a column’s definition:

```sql
column_name data_type(length) [NOT NULL] [DEFAULT value] [AUTO_INCREMENT] column_constraint;
```

Here are the details:

- The `column_name` specifies the name of the column. Each column has a specific data type and optional size e.g. `VARCHAR(255)`
- The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that the column will not contain `NULL`. Besides the `NOT NULL` constraint, a column may have - additional constraint such as `CHECK`, and `UNIQUE`.
- The `DEFAULT` specifies a default value for the column.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` indicates that the value of the column is incremented by one automatically whenever a new row is inserted - into the table. Each table has a maximum one `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

After the column list, you can define table constraints such as `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`.

For example, if you want to set a column or a group of columns as the primary key, you use the following syntax:

```sql
PRIMARY KEY (col1,col2,...)
```

### Example

Let’s take some examples of creating new tables. The following statement creates a new table named `tasks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    task_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE,
    due_date DATE,
    status TINYINT NOT NULL,
    priority TINYINT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)  ENGINE=INNODB;
```

The tasks table has the following columns:

- The `task_id` is an auto-increment column. If you use the `INSERT` statement to insert a new row into the table without specifying a value for the `task_id` column, MySQL will automatically generate a sequential integer for the `task_id` starting from **1**.
- The `title` column is a variable character string column whose maximum length is 255. It means that you cannot insert a string whose length is greater than 255 into this column. The `NOT NULL` constraint indicates that the column does not accept `NULL`. In other words, you have to provide a non-NULL value when you insert or update this column.
- The `start_date` and `due_date` are `DATE` columns. Because these columns do not have the `NOT NULL` constraint, they can store `NULL`. The `start_date` column has a default value of the current date. In other words, if you don’t provide a value for the `start_date` column when you insert a new row, the `start_date` column will take the current date of the **database server**.
- The `status` and `priority` are the `TINYINT` columns which do not allow `NULL`.
- The `description` column is a `TEXT` column that accepts `NULL`.
- The `created_at` is a `TIMESTAMP` column that accepts the current time as the default value.

The `task_id` is the primary key column of the `tasks` table. It means that the values in the `task_id` column will uniquely identify rows in the table.

Once you execute the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create the `tasks` table, you can view its structure by using the `DESCRIBE` statement:

```sql
DESCRIBE tasks;
```

## `AUTO_INCREMENT`

In MySQL, a sequence is a list of integers generated in the ascending order i.e., 1,2,3… Many applications **need sequences to generate unique numbers mainly for identification** e.g., customer ID in CRM, employee numbers in HR, and equipment numbers in the services management system.

### Syntax

To create a sequence in MySQL automatically, you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute for a column, which typically is a primary key column.

```sql
column_name INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE
```

The following rules are applied when you use the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute:

- Each table has **only one** `AUTO_INCREMENT` column whose data type is typically the integer.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column must be indexed, which means it can be either `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` index.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column must have a `NOT NULL` constraint. When you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute to a column, MySQL automatically adds the `NOT NULL` constraint to the column **implicitly**.

### Example

The following statement creates a table named `employees` that has the `emp_no` column is an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_no INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

:::tip

The `AUTO_INCREMENT` column has the following attributes:

- The starting value of an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is **1** and it is increased by 1 when you insert a `NULL` value into the column or when you omit its value in the `INSERT` statement.
- To obtain the last generated sequence number, you use the `LAST_INSERT_ID()` function. We often use the last insert ID for the subsequent statements e.g., insert data into the tables. The last generated sequence is unique across sessions. In other words, if another connection generates a sequence number, from your connection you can obtain it by using `the LAST_INSERT_ID()` function.
- If you insert a new row into a table and specify a value for the sequence column, MySQL will insert the sequence number if the sequence number does not exist in the column or issue an error if it already exists. If you insert a new value that is greater than the next sequence number, MySQL will use the new value as the starting sequence number and generate a unique sequence number greater than the current one for the next usage. This creates gaps in the sequence.
- If you use the `UPDATE` statement to update values in the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a value that already exists, MySQL will issue a duplicate-key error if the column has a unique index. If you update an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a value that is greater than the existing values in the column, MySQL will use the next number of the **last** insert sequence number for the next row. For example, if the last insert sequence number is 3, you update it to 10, the sequence number for the new row is 4.
- If you use the `DELETE` statement to delete the last inserted row, MySQL may or may not reuse the deleted sequence number depending on the storage engine of the table.
  - A MyISAM table does not reuse the deleted sequence numbers if you delete a row e.g., the last insert id in the table is 10, if you remove it, MySQL still generates the next sequence number which is 11 for the new row.
  - Similar to MyISAM tables, InnoDB tables do not reuse sequence number when rows are deleted.

Once you set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute for a column, you can reset the auto increment value in various ways e.g., by using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

## `GENERATED ALWAYS`

### Background

When you create a new table, you specify the table columns in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Then, you use the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to modify directly the data in the table columns.

:::info

MySQL 5.7 introduced a new feature called the generated column. Columns are generated because the data in these columns are **computed** based on predefined expressions.

:::

For example, you have the `contacts` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

To get the full name of a contact, you use the `CONCAT()` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name), email FROM contacts;
```

This is not the most beautiful query yet. By using the MySQL generated column, you can recreate the `contacts` table as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fullname varchar(101) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)),
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

The `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` is the syntax for creating a generated column. To test the `fullname` column, you insert a row into the `contacts` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO contacts(first_name,last_name, email)
VALUES('john','doe','kiki@abc.com');
```

Now, you can query data from the `contacts` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts;
```

<Img w="400" align="left" src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/NhDcvs.png' />

The values in the `fullname` column are computed on the fly when you query data from the `contacts` table.

MySQL provides two types of generated columns:

- **Virtual** columns are calculated on the fly each time data is read.
- **Stored** column are calculated and stored physically when the data is updated.

Based on this definition, the `fullname` column that in the example above is a virtual column.

### Syntax

```sql
column_name data_type [GENERATED ALWAYS] AS (expression) [VIRTUAL | STORED] [UNIQUE [KEY]]
```

First, specify the column name and its data type.

Next, add the `GENERATED ALWAYS` clause to indicate that the column is a generated column.

Then, specify the expression within the braces after the `AS` keyword. The expression can contain literals, built-in functions with no parameters, operators, or references to any column within the same table. If you use a function, it must be scalar and deterministic.

After that, indicate whether the type of the generated column by using the corresponding option: `VIRTUAL` or `STORED`. By default, MySQL uses `VIRTUAL` if you don’t specify explicitly the type of the generated column.

Finally, if the generated column is stored, you can define a unique constraint for it.

### Example

Let’s look at the `products` table in the sample database.

<Img w="280" align="left" src='https://cosmos-x.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/R7YL80.png' />

The data from `quantityInStock` and `buyPrice` columns allow us to calculate the stock’s value per SKU using the following expression:

```sql
quantityInStock * buyPrice
```

However, we can add a stored generated column named `stock_value` to the `products` table using the following `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN stockValue DOUBLE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantityInStock * buyPrice) STORED;
```

Typically, the `ALTER TABLE` statement requires a full table rebuild, therefore, it is time-consuming if you change the big tables. However, this is not the case for the virtual column.

Now, we can query the `stock_value` directly from the `products` table.

```sql
SELECT productName, ROUND(stockValue, 2) stock_value FROM products;
```
