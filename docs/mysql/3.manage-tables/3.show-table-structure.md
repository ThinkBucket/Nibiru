title: Show Table Structure
---

After creating tables by SQL statement, we can check the definition of table. In MySQL, using `DESCRIBE` and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements to show the table structure, see as follows:

## Using SQL

### Show the basic structure: `DESCRIBE`

`DESCRIBE` or `DESC` statement can show the field info including column name, type, is primary and default value. Syntax as following shows:

```sql
DESCRIBE <table_name>;
```

or

```sql
DESC <table_name>;
```

For example, letâ€™s look at the `products` table structure in the sample database.

```sql
DESC products;
```

- **Null**: whether can store NULL value
- **Key**: means this column has been indexed
  - **PRI**: means it's the part of table primary key
  - **UNI**: means it's the part of UNIQUE index
  - **MUL**: means it allow the specific value can be shown in many times
- **Default**: default value
- **Extra**: extra info such as `AUTO_INCREMENT`

### Show the detailed structure: `SHOW CREATE TABLE`

This statement can show the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements when creating table, syntax as follows:

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE <table_name>\G;
```

When using `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, it can not only show the detailed statements, but also shows the store engines and character encoding.

The results may be in chaos if miss `\G` at the end.

Adding `\G` to make the result more visible:
