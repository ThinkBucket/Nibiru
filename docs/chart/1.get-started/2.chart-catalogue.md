#### Description

As known as Bar Graph or Column Graph.

A Bar Chart uses either horizontal or vertical bars (column chart) to show discrete, numerical comparisons across categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared and the other axis represents a discrete value scale.

Bar Charts are distinguished from Histograms, as they do not display continuous developments over an interval. Instead, Bar Chart's discrete data is categorical and therefore answers the question of "how many?" in each category.

#### Description

A Histogram visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval. Each bar in a histogram represents the tabulated frequency at each interval/bin.

Histograms help give an estimate as to where values are concentrated, what the extremes are and whether there are any gaps or unusual values. They are also useful for giving a rough view of the probability distribution.
