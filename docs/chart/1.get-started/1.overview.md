Data is only as good as how well you can communicate what it means. Charts and graphs should make the information clear. If you select the wrong chart type, you can either confuse the audience or lead to mistaken data interpretation. Before you create another presentation, make sure you choose the accurate type of chart to clearly communicate your information.

## Dr. Andrew Abela’s method

Perhaps the best known, it is based on a chart selection diagram created in 2009 by Dr. Andrew Abela as part of the [Extreme Presentation](https://extremepresentation.com/design/7-charts/) method.

It all starts by asking what you want to represent with the data, and according to the answer the charts can be grouped into four main types:

- **Comparison**: when we want to compare the different values or attributes within the data with each other. There are some variants, depending on the data. For example: Does the data include the time variable? How many time periods? How many variables and categories do the data present?.
- **Composition**: when we want to know how the data is composed, that is, what general characteristics are present in the data set. There are some variants, depending on the data. For example: Are there changes over time? With how many time periods? In static data, do you have values that accumulate?.
- **Distribution**: when we want to understand how the individual data points are distributed within the entire data set. Depending on the number of variables in which we want to analyze the distribution, we can choose bar charts, line charts or scatter charts.
- **Relationship**: in this case we are interested in knowing how the values and attributes are related to each other. To face the values, scatter charts are usually used when two variables are involved, and bubble charts are used when three variables are involved.

Of these four types, it is most likely that in the majority of cases the first two, **Comparison** and **Composition**, will be used, unless you have advanced statistical analysis needs.

As you can see, most cases can be solved with a few types of basic charts, although multiple variants can be applied for each specific case. We can say that the most used charts are those of bars and lines in all their variants (horizontal or vertical, simple or stacked, etc.). When great detail is required, the data table is generally used.
