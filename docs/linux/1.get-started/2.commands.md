## ln

Create soft link:

```bash
ln -s target_path source_path # source_path is where the soft link locates
```

> There should be no same name file on the current path, otherwise will hit the error.

Update soft link:

```bash
ln -snf target_path source_path

```

Remove soft link:

```bash
ln -snf source_path
```

> There can't be a "/" at the end of "source_path", and if there is, it means it will delete the resource under the directory, not the soft link itself.
